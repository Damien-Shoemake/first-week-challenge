# Code Refactor Starter Code

## In the first week's challenge of the coding bootcamp, we were instructed to Refactor code from a social solutions website. 

<br>

- The goal here is to better understand HTML and CSS formatting, as well as the importance of writing clean, semantic code. 
- This project was built to get a feel for a hands on approach to refactoring. 
- This project solves the problem of repetitive code, and makes the coding easier to understand and more accessible. 
- I learned about class structure and website structure with this project, as well as good habits to practice for cleaner code.
